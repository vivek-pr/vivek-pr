#
🚀 **Hello, fellow developers!** I'm a seasoned backend engineer and DevOps specialist with over a decade of hands-on experience in the trenches of software development. 

🐍 Over the years, I've mastered Python and Django, and have also ventured into JavaScript, Go, and most recently, Rust. I pride myself on being a lifelong learner, always eager to explore new technologies and paradigms.

🏗️ As a veteran software engineer, I've successfully built and deployed over 20 large-scale projects, including one with a staggering 5 million active users. My expertise ranges from designing robust and scalable architectures to optimizing infrastructure and deployment pipelines.

🚀 I've had the privilege of working closely with startups, playing a pivotal role in helping two of them secure their Series A funding. My diverse experience allows me to provide valuable insights, from product development to growth strategies.

💼 Currently, I'm focused on optimizing backend systems and diving deeper into Rust. I'm also open to collaborations and love to share my knowledge. If you're looking for some advice, mentorship, or just want to chat about all things backend and DevOps, feel free to reach out!

📚 _"Stay curious, keep learning, and keep growing."_
